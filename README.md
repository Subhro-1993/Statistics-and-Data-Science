# Statistics-and-Data-Science

We demonstrate how various descriptive and inferential statistical methods and analysis can be applied to the National Basketball Association(nba), 2014-2015 dataset, and how their results might be interpreted and presented. Here we analysed the success of each player, the basketball teams and their respective performance. We showed the top fifteen best performances by graph in our player perforamance section. We illustrated the nba dataset and produced some insight into the best-performing player and best-performing ground. We evaluated closest defender, shot distance, dribbles, number of two or three pointers and shot distance by the players which produced the statistical evidence for performance of each player. We also performed inferential analysis, t-test and finally present the results of a logistic-regression analysis and demonstrated that to a certain extent it was possible to distinguish between the players by the scores and achieved a subset of the nba events.
